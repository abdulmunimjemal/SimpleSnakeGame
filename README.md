# Simple Snake Game in Java

This is a simple snake game implemented in Java using the Swing library for the graphical user interface (GUI). It was developed as a hobby project to practice coding skills and demonstrate the use of Java Swing for creating interactive applications.

## Features

- Basic gameplay: control a snake on the screen to eat apple and grow in size. (Both W-A-S-D and UP-DOWN-LEFT-RIGHT arrow supported for control) 
- Score tracking: keep track of the player's score as they eat the apple and grow the snake.
- Game over: detect collisions with the snake's own body or the game boundaries, ending the game.
- Graphical user interface: utilize Java Swing to provide a visually appealing and interactive game window.

## Future Expandability

This project was developed with future expandability in mind. Here are some potential areas for improvement and expansion:

1. Levels and difficulties: Implement different levels with varying speeds or obstacles to provide a more challenging gameplay experience.
2. High scores and leaderboard: Implement a high score tracking system and display a leaderboard to encourage competition among players.
3. Sound effects and music: Enhance the gaming experience by adding sound effects and background music.
4. Customization options: Allow players to customize the appearance of the snake, apple, or game window with different colors or themes.

## How to Run the Game

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
3. Open the project in your preferred Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE).
4. Build and run the project from your IDE.
5. The game window should appear, and you can start playing the snake game using the arrow keys or designated controls.
